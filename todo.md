## Priority Order

### High Priority (Core Functionality) - COMPLETED ✅
1. ~~Update all database files in `db/` directory~~ ✅
2. ~~Create essential API endpoints~~ ✅ (Mock implementation ready for backend)
3. ~~Update authentication components~~ ✅
4. ~~Test basic functionality~~ ✅ (Static export builds successfully)

### Medium Priority (Features) - COMPLETED ✅
1. ~~Update chat and sidebar components~~ ✅
2. ~~Implement storage functionality~~ ✅ (Mock implementation ready)
3. ~~Update type definitions~~ ✅
4. ~~Add error handling~~ ✅

### Low Priority (Polish) - IN PROGRESS
1. ~~Update documentation~~ ✅ (Partially done)
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Optimize performance
4. Add advanced features

## Notes

- The new system uses localhost API endpoints instead of direct database calls
- Authentication is now cookie-based instead of JWT tokens
- File storage is handled through API endpoints instead of direct Supabase storage
- All database operations should be implemented as REST API endpoints
- The current implementation uses mock data - real backend implementation is needed

## Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Frontend Migration Status**: All frontend components have been successfully migrated from Supabase to the new localhost-based API system. The static export builds without errors.

**What's Working**:
- ✅ All database client files updated to use new API endpoints
- ✅ All React components updated to use new database client
- ✅ Type definitions migrated from Supabase types to generic types
- ✅ Static export configuration enabled
- ✅ API route prefix changed from `/api/` to `/pico/v1/`
- ✅ Authentication flow updated to cookie-based system
- ✅ Build process works with mock data

**Ready for Phase 2**: Swift Hummingbird backend implementation to replace mock endpoints.

## Questions for Later Investigation

### Static Export and Database Calls During Build
**Issue**: During Next.js static export build, TypeScript errors occur because API responses return `{}` instead of expected objects with proper properties.

**Question**: How did the original Supabase setup handle database calls during static export? Was there:
1. Build-time mocking mechanism?
2. Conditional logic to skip API calls during build?
3. Some other approach to prevent these calls during static generation?

**Current Status**: Added minimal `(as any)` type assertions to resolve immediate build errors, but this is a temporary workaround. Need to understand the proper long-term solution.
