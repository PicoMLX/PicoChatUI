# Cursor Rules for TypeScript Development

## Goal

We're porting the original project, which you can find in the `ORIGINAL PROJECT` directory in the root 
repo directory to a Swift Hummingbird server. For that purpose, we've removed the Next.js server component
and Supabase.
The front-end end works well and you should treat the front-end in the `ORIGINAL PROJECT` as the source of truth.
Only edit the front-end files when absolutely necessary. When in doubt, consult the files in the
`ORIGINAL PROJECT` directory.

## Architecture Migration

### Current State
- Frontend uses `db/*.ts` functions that currently call a mock client (`lib/db/client.ts`)
- Target: Replace mock client with HTTP API calls to Swift Hummingbird server
- **REST-Native Design**: Use simple, clean REST endpoints instead of forcing REST to mimic Supabase's complex query builder

### Migration Constraints
- **KEEP db/*.ts function signatures EXACTLY the same** - frontend depends on these stable interfaces
- **DO NOT modify frontend code** - it should continue calling the same database functions
- **DO NOT change return types** of database functions in db/*.ts
- **DESIGN REST-NATIVE APIs** - simple HTTP endpoints instead of complex query builders
- **Migrate one function at a time** to minimize risk and enable incremental testing

### REST-Native Design Principles
- Use simple, intuitive REST endpoints that are easy to implement in Swift
- Prefer query parameters over complex chained methods
- Design clean HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) instead of Supabase-style query builders
- Use standard HTTP status codes for error handling
- Maintain proper TypeScript types for all API responses

## Type Safety Rules

### NEVER Use `any` Type Casts
- **NEVER** add `(as any)` type casts to suppress TypeScript errors
- **NEVER** use `any` type in function parameters, return types, or variable declarations
- **ALWAYS** ask the user if they want to create a proper type definition instead

### When TypeScript Errors Occur
1. **First**: Identify what the correct type should be
2. **Second**: Check if the type already exists in `supabase/types.ts` or other type files
3. **Third**: If type doesn't exist, **ASK THE USER** if they want to create a new type
4. **Fourth**: Only as a last resort and with explicit user permission, use minimal type assertions

### Proper Type Definition Process
1. Analyze the data structure causing the error
2. Look for existing compatible types in the codebase
3. Propose creating a new interface/type with proper structure
4. Get user approval before creating new types
5. Add the type to the appropriate file (usually `supabase/types.ts` for database-related types)

### Examples of What NOT to Do
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Don't suppress errors with any
const data = (await apiCall()) as any
const files = data.files || []

// ❌ WRONG - Don't use any in function parameters  
function processData(data: any) { ... }
```

### Examples of What TO Do
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use proper types
interface ApiResponse {
  files: FileRow[]
}
const data = (await apiCall()) as ApiResponse
const files = data.files || []

// ✅ CORRECT - REST-Native API calls
export async function getWorkspaceById(id: string): Promise<WorkspaceRow> {
  return await apiClient.get<WorkspaceRow>(`/api/workspaces/${id}`)
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Ask user to create missing types
// "I see this API returns { files: FileRow[], collections: CollectionRow[] }. 
// Should I create a new type interface for this response structure?"
```

### Type Safety Checklist
- [ ] No `(as any)` casts in the code
- [ ] All function parameters have proper types
- [ ] All return types are explicitly defined
- [ ] API responses use proper interface definitions
- [ ] User was consulted before creating new types
- [ ] REST-Native API design with simple HTTP endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling with HTTP status codes
- [ ] TypeScript types match expected API response structures

## Remember
Type safety is not optional. Every TypeScript error is pointing to a real potential runtime issue. Address the root cause, don't mask it with `any`.

## Migration Strategy
When migrating from mock client to HTTP API:
1. **Create `lib/api/client.ts`** with proper HTTP client implementation
2. **Design REST-native endpoints** that are simple and intuitive
3. **Migrate one function at a time** to minimize risk
4. **Maintain exact function signatures** in `db/*.ts` files
5. **Use proper TypeScript types** for all API responses
6. **Test each migration** to ensure build passes and functionality works
